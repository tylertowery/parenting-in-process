          <h3>Connection</h3>
          <p>Parenting is more than just a set of skills. It is, first and foremost, a relationship. Parenting through connection is about deepening the quality of relationship between parent and child, as both learn and grow as individuals and a family. Keeping connection at the heart of parenting is key.</p>

          <h3>&quot;Good Enough&quot; Parenting</h3>
          <p>Parents aren&apos;t meant to get it perfect and striving for perfection gets in the way of being the parents that children need. There is power in repair and with a willingness to learn, grow, and keep showing up, parents can “be” who their children need: perfectly imperfect and human. Good enough really is good enough.</p>

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>Reflection gives way to empowered parenting. With reflection, parents can bring conscious awareness to their parenting, and explore what barriers might be preventing them from meeting their child&apos;s needs and making the changes they desire. Reflection brings awareness, and with awareness you have choice. </p>
